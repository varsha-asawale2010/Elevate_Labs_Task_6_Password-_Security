### Note Scores and Feedback from the Tool

1. Time to Crack: Estimates how long it would take for an attacker to guess the password.
2. Strength Rating: Categorizes the password as weak, moderate, or strong.
3. Recommendations: Suggestions to improve password strength, like adding symbols or increasing length.

### Identify Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
Length Over Complexity: Longer passwords are generally more secure than shorter, complex ones. Aim for at least 12-16 characters.<br>

Use Passphrases: Combining random words (e.g., orange!Tiger?Mango#) creates memorable yet strong passwords.<br>

Avoid Common Words and Patterns: Steer clear of easily guessable words, sequences, or personal information.<br>

Incorporate Variety: Mix uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.<br>

### Tips Learned from the Evaluation
Passphrases Enhance Memorability: Using a sequence of unrelated words can be both secure and easier to remember.<br>

Randomness Is Key: The more unpredictable your password, the better.<br>

Regular Updates: Change passwords periodically, especially if a breach is suspected.<br>

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security can protect accounts even if a password is compromised.<br>

### Research Common Password Attacks

Brute Force Attacks: Attackers try every possible combination to guess a password. Longer and more complex passwords increase the time required to crack them.<br>

Dictionary Attacks: Attackers use a list of common words and phrases to guess passwords. Avoiding dictionary words and using unique combinations can mitigate this risk. <br>

### Summarize How Password Complexity Affects Security

Simple Passwords: Easily compromised through dictionary or brute force attacks.<br>

Moderate Complexity: Better but still vulnerable if based on common patterns.<br>

High Complexity: Significantly increases security, especially when combined with length and randomness.<br>

Passphrases: Offer a balance between security and memorability, especially when composed of unrelated words.<br>
